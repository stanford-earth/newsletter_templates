** Is shale gas the blue bridge to a green future? (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kypbngpeqwg)
------------------------------------------------------------

Geophysics professor Mark Zoback, a leading international expert on hydraulic fracturing, is working closely with governments in the U.S., Canada and China to address safe extraction of shale gas.  He recently discussed this lightning rod issue with a highly-engaged audience in a new lecture series sponsored by the School of Earth Sciences and Stanford Continuing Studies. View video...

** Iron melt network helped grow Earth’s core, study suggests (http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/october/grow-earth-core-100613.html)
------------------------------------------------------------

A discovery by Geological and Environmental Sciences professor Wendy Mao and colleagues complicates theories of how Earth and its core formed.  By utilizing  a state of the art x-ray microscope they were able to observe never-before-seen changes in the texture and shape of molten iron and silicates as they responded to the same intense pressures and temperatures that were present deep in early Earth.

** Climate change on pace to occur 10X faster than any change recorded in past 65 million years (http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/august/climate-change-speed-080113.html)
------------------------------------------------------------

Noah Diffenbaugh and Chris Field, both on faculty in Environmental Earth System Science, teamed up to review climate research that was featured in a special report on climate change in the journal Science.  They say that if the trend continues at the current rapid pace, it will place significant stress on terrestrial ecosystems around the world. Read more...

Faculty News & Honors
http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/september/macarthur-fellowship-awards-092513.html


** David Lobell and Kevin Boyce named 2013 MacArthur fellows (http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/september/macarthur-fellowship-awards-092513.html)
------------------------------------------------------------

When the phone rang, David Lobell saw a relatively unfamiliar area code, so he didn't answer.  Kevin Boyce cringed at the thought of interrupting yet another attempt to enjoy lunch with faculty colleague Jonathan Payne.  Both ultimately answered their phones to hear surprising news from the MacArthur Foundation.  As they consider the impact of the fellowships and how to use the unrestricted $625,000 grants, Boyce (left) and Lobell are looking forward to the October 19 football game vs. UCLA when they will be introduced to more than 50,000 fans as new members of Stanford's Nerd Nation.

** Digging into the rich past of farming in Hawai’i (http://youtu.be/D3GQtR54cJI)
------------------------------------------------------------

The farming practices in Hawai’i of 400 years ago were believed to be highly intensive and productive.  The fields went fallow when hundreds and thousands of native Hawai’ians died from contagious diseases brought by Europeans. Today, Prof. Peter Vitousek and Earth Systems students are trying to learn about farming approaches from the past that could be useful for the world today. View video...

** Paper or plastic? Cloth or disposable diapers? (http://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/sage)
------------------------------------------------------------

Answers to these questions and more are offered by SAGE, a Stanford project dedicated to providing sound environmental information and advice.   Students in the course “Sustaining Action: Research, Analysis and Writing for the Public” write the answers based on in-depth investigation of the scientific, engineering and social aspects of environmental sustainability. The students welcome your questions. Read more... (http://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/sage)
